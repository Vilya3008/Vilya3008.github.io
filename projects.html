<h1>VR immercion</h1>
<p>1. I could say that the virtual reality is one of the largest steps of humanity to the future technologies. I had experienced the PlayStation VR before this class, the game was about to go down to the depths of the sea and to fight with a shark, it was amazing. The first time when I put on the helmet, I thought about how far people can reach their ideas with things like that. About the Very Safari, it was good but not the feelings of the first time watching.
<p>2.To start with, to learn how the controls works was very easy for me, even I have never tried to watch VR with controls. The painting system that was created for the VR was very entertaining and funny to do. I like the idea that your drawings could be different if you look on it from different positions. To compare the live painting and VR, VR will never reach the level of mastery of the live painting, because people are putting their souls in to the art but you won’t be able to see it in digital codes, it just codes.
<p>3.The video that I watched in VR was a trailer of a game. You are looking from a side angle at the guy that was running from the police and how mastery and what tricks were he using and you can observe it from different angles. As for me, this was one of the best you tube videos in VR. Touching the experience, it is very entertaining to watch things like that, maybe those things could help you with something or give you an idea or inspiration. I am not saying that it will be good help for running from police:).
<p>4.This was definitely one of the first time when I took pictures on 360 cameras to see it from different angles. I would say that it is very interesting but the idea would not challenge with powerful digital camera. The quality of the image is one of the most important things that people most likely to see and to do these days. Technologies are growing fast these days, maybe it would still be the winner. I would not say that I need a 360 camera to picture some special moments of my life, the usual camera can do the same. It has no difference for me.
<p>5.Answering this question, I want to say that the most major difference for all people is the price:). Anyway, it has no difference for me except you don’t have any controls for the cardboard. I know that Oculus is the top VR for games. Cardboard and Samsung VR are the best to watch different videos. Using your hands as a tool in VR is very helpful for most of the people, it is a smart move for the creators, also people can be more involved in to Virtual playgrounds.
<p>6.For my opinion, I think that people could present VR to all kind of aspects of life, like: sport, gaming, education but unfortunately not for health. It is simple to know that VR as any kind of devise that involves your eyes and brain is taking maybe the smallest but still the piece of your health, and there is nothing that could be done. I think that the best way it could help is an education. Mostly it was created for the entertaining programs
